# Greater Manchester Road Accidents Analysis
Road accident is one of the most dangerous threats to the health and lives of people around the world today, thousands of deaths are as a result of road accidents every year. In a bid to proffer solutions to the occurrence of road accidents, I did an analysis of Greater Manchester county road accident dataset using Python, Greater Manchester is a metropolitan county and combined authority area in North West England, with a population of 2.8 million. I provided some recommendations that can help reduce road accidents in this county.

## Recommendations
1. Facilities such as overhead bridge for pedestrians should be provided for safe crossing of pedestrians and other road users.
2. Traffic wardens should be provided during rush hours of the day.
3. Traffic control devices should be installed at appropriate places for road users to see and follow.
4. There should be regular public enlightenment education of the general public especially the motorists on the proper use of the road and road signs.
5. There should be strict penalties for road users that fail to follow the road signs and rules.
